# Intro-to-LLMs
### This repo will contain code and notes written while learning about LLMs

## Notes
**Zero-shot Learning:** The capability of a (machine learning) model tocomplete a task it was not explicity trained to do.

**Levels of Using LLMs:**
  - Level 1 Prompt Engineering: no changing any model parameters. 
  - Level 2 Model Fine-tuning: adjusting at least 1 (internal) model parameter (but not all) for a particular task.
      - Obtain pre-trained LLM
      - Update model parameters given task-specific examples.
      - Deploy      - 
  - Level 3 Build Your Own
**Tokens:** a set of words and characters represented a set of numbers
